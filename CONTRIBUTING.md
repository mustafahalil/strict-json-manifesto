â”œâ”€â”€ CONTRIBUTING.md
```

**Supported languages (in progress):**

- ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Japanese (æ—¥æœ¬èªž) â€” Help wanted

### 2. Share Your Experience

Help us learn how these principles work in the real world:

- **Success story**: "We adopted Strict JSON and reduced NullPointerExceptions by 80%"
- **Challenge**: "Rule X is hard to implement in our language"
- **Question**: "How should Rule Y apply to our use case?"

Open an issue with:
- Your organization (optional)
- Principle number (if applicable)
- Your experience (2-3 paragraphs)

### 3. Report Issues

Found problems? Help us improve:

- **Contradiction**: "Rule 1 and Rule 15 conflict because..."
- **Unclear rule**: "Rule X doesn't explain..."
- **Missing example**: "Rule Y needs examples in TypeScript"
- **Typo/Grammar**: "Found typo on line X"

### 4. Add Your Signature

Using these principles in your project or organization?

- **Individual**: Fork â†’ add your entry to `SIGNATORIES.json` â†’ PR
- **Organization**: Same process, add organization info
- **Tool/Implementation**: Link your tool and document which rules you follow

### 5. Build an Implementation

Create a tool/library following these rules in your language:

- See [IMPLEMENTATIONS.md](./IMPLEMENTATIONS.md) for guidelines
- Document which rules you enforce
- Add your tool to the "In the Wild" section
- Open a PR linking your repository

### 6. Improve Documentation

- Fix unclear wording
- Add better examples
- Improve formatting
- Clarify edge cases

## Proposing Rule Changes

Rules are strict because they solve real problems for the 99%. Rule changes require:

1. **Open an issue** describing:
   - Current rule and its problem
   - Proposed change
   - Why change helps (with examples)
   - Languages/implementations affected

2. **Discussion phase** (1-2 weeks)
   - Community feedback
   - Maintainers evaluate
   - Consider impact

3. **If accepted**: Create PR with:
   - Rule change
   - Updated examples
   - Updated verification checklist
   - Rationale section

### Bar for Rule Changes

**High bar** â€” must solve problems for 99% use case, not edge cases:

- âœ“ "Rule X breaks this common pattern, here's evidence..."
- âœ— "My specific edge case doesn't work..."
- âœ“ "Rule incompatible with language X, alternatives are..."
- âœ— "I prefer different approach..."
